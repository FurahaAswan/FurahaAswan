# Project Reflections

## 1. St. Paul Crime Finder

### Project Overview
[St. Paul Crime Finder](https://github.com/DevDroid42/Assignment-4-Single-Page-Application) is a web application designed to help users find, upload, and delete crimes from a database focusing on St. Paul, MN neighborhoods. The app provides an interactive and responsive interface for users to investigate incidents in different areas.

### Project-level README.md
As I do not own the repository, I've decided to include the projct-level "README.md" directly in this file. The project is built using a combination of front-end and back-end technologies. The front-end utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, it uses the frontend framework Vue.js. The back-end, powered by Node.js and Express, manages the database, and the core functionality of uploading and deleting crime data. This is done with a RESTFUL API that the front-end communicates with. This project was a great introduction to web development and taught me a lot. I learnt how modern single-page web application are created and what goes into making a streamlined UI. 

## 2. ClueMaster

### Project Overview
[ClueMaster](https://github.com/FurahaAswan/ClueMaster/) is a multiplayer online guessing game that challenges players to guess a word or phrase based on progressively more specific clues. The game blends creativity, wordplay, and quick thinking in a dynamic and entertaining environment, similar to popular games like Skribbl.

## 3. BuddyBuffer

### Project Overview
[BuddyBuffer](https://github.com/FurahaAswan/BuddyBuffer/) This was a project that I worked on in CISC 310 - Operating Systems. This is a memory management system that handles the allocation and deallocation of memory blocks. It's dynamic and automatic. The memory blocks adjust to the file size. I learned about memory management and got a better understanding of binary trees and linked lists.
